# Part of Speech Tagging with Hidden Markov Model
By Patavee Meemeng

This code is developed for educational propose. I do experiment on many variations of HMM. The results are benchmarked with [Scikit-learn HMM](http://scikit-learn.sourceforge.net/stable/modules/hmm.html).

This code is used to calculate the baseline accuracy. The baseline tagger gives the most common tag for each word.
